# Girard Rails

girard-rails is a website to present my expertise in ruby on rails development.

## Architecture

This website will be a simple collection of HTML and CSS file. I'm a backend engineer not a website designer. To be concistent with my content, the server will run on ruby technologies. The server will be a Rack app hosted on heroku.

## Setup

gem install bundler
bundle install
rackup
